## Focus Mode

The first feature that most markdown editors do not have is, focus the paragraph you are actually writing. It reduces a lot of distractions when you are working on a long post. Use <kbd>Ctrl/CMD + \</kbd> to toggle it.

## Distraction Free Mode

One step further, you may want to hide the header and footer when you are writing in full-screen. Use <kbd>Ctrl/CMD + J</kbd> to toggle it.

## Vim Mode

For developers, you may miss the vim key binding, here it is. Use <kbd>Ctrl/CMD + I</kbd> to toggle it.

## Presentation Mode

You can event write markdown and render then in slides! Here's an example:

```markdown
# title 
## subtitle

---

# another title
## another subtitle
```

Use <kbd>Ctrl/CMD + K</kbd> to toggle it!
