## Development

```bash
# Install all dependencies
$ npm run install:all

# Run in dev mode
$ npm run dev

# The first launch requires the access to google web store to download vue-devtools
# So you'd better launch it with an https_proxy, like Lantern
$ https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8787 npm run dev
```
